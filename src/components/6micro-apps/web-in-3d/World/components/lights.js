// PBR - Lighting and materials - involves calculating, in a physically correct manner, how light reacts with surfaces.
// Physically correct lighting means calculating how light fades with distance from a light source (attenuation) using real-world physics equations.
// Well crafted physically based materials look great in all lighting conditions.

// Direct lighting
// InDirect lighting - mostly Ambient lights - faking indirect lighting - indirect lighting is much harder to simulate since doing so
// requires calculating an infinite number of light rays bouncing forever from all the surfaces in the scene.
// calculating a few thousand light rays, each making just a couple of bounces (raytracing), it still generally takes too long to calculate in real-time.
